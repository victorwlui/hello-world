# hello-world

Hi guys!

My name is Victor Lui. I am very passionate about computer science and engineering and would love to learn as much as possible. If I could have one wish, it would be to have more time! There are so many topics and subjects in the field of computer engineering that it would be impossible to learn everthing in a given lifetime.
